I discovered this song during my month-long metalcore phase back in February, and a whole year later, I haven't found a track nearly as gloomy. I think WWLTSoitS succeeds at this because of its instrumentation: acoustic guitar was the perfect instrument for the job, and the vocals are perfectly distant, cold, haunting, all of that (thanks to the reverb). Not sure how best to describe the guitar on this, but I'd say it sounds like a death sentence. Like you're about to be executed, or something like that. Executed sonically. Or as if it's saying: \"it's over.\" (a phrase I use quite often). This song was not my favorite of the year but it's definitely top 10. You won't find another song like it. If you do, let me know. Edit: I found ",["$","a",null,{"href":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfmlaATBjA0","target":"_blank","className":"text-[#b80000]","children":" a somewhat similar song"}]," recently (February 2025).

That one blows my mind for how boring and simultaneously popular it is. WHO is listening to this???? Some things just don't make any sense. QKThr (next up in popularity), on the other hand, is actually interesting and has emotion. But it's definitely not in my top 10 in the album. Next two favorites from this album are probably Ziggomatic 17, Mt Saint Michel + Saint Michaels Mount, and 54 Cymru Beats. Craziest drum programming you'll ever hear.
