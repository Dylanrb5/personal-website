I know what you might be thinking, but hear me out.

It just happens to be that there's plenty of great material (TV Shows & Music) for immersing yourself in the language. Japanese also happens to have pronounciation very similar to Spanish (my true first language). Maybe I don't have a really great practical reason for learning Japanese, but I've stuck with it for nearly a year now, (since April 2024), mostly thanks to Anki, the flash card app. Vocabulary is probably the biggest issue when learning new languages, but I've been able to learn 2,000 words in less than a year thanks to this app. And once you're at this point, it's hard to just drop the language for good, so I really do think I could be fluent in a few years."}),n.jsx("p",{className:"mb-8",children:"Tldr, I stuck with it just because I felt like it and because it's difficult."}),n.jsx("p",{className:"mb-3 text-5xl",children:"Fun Facts:"}),n.jsx("p",{className:"mb-8",children:'天井 (Tenjō) is "ceiling" in English, which is "techo" in Spanish.

You learn very very slowly...
